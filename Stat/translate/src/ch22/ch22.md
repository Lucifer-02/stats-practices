# Measuring Employment and Unemployment

_The country is hungry for information; everything of a statistical character, or even
a statistical appearance, is taken up with an eagerness that is almost pathetic; the
community have not yet learned to be half skeptical and critical enough in respect
to such statements._

GENERAL FRANCIS A. WALKER, SUPERINTENDENT OF THE 1870 CENSUS
