# A Model for Measurement Error

_Upon the whole of which it appears, that the taking of the Mean of a number of observations, greatly diminishes the chance for all the smaller errors, and cuts off almost all possibility of any great ones: which last consideration, alone, seems sufficient to recommend the use of the method, not only to astronomers, but to all others concerned in making experiments of any kind (to which the above reasoning is equally applicable). And the more observations or experiments there are made, the less will the conclusions be liable to error, provided they admit of being repeated under the same circumstances._

THOMAS SIMPSON (ENGLISH MATHEMATICIAN, 1710â€“1761)
