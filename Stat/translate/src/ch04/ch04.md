# The Average and the Standard Deviation
_It is difficult to understand why statisticians commonly limit their enquiries to
Averages, and do not revel in more comprehensive views. Their souls seem as dull to
the charm of variety as that of the native of one of our flat English counties, whose
retrospect of Switzerland was that, if its mountains could be thrown into its lakes,
two nuisances would be got rid of at once._
—SIR FRANCIS GALTON (ENGLAND, 1822–1911)[^1]
